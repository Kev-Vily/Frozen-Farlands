## turrets
block.moon-mod-Defragmentation.name = Defragmentation
block.moon-mod-Alectro.name = Alectro
block.moon-mod-Alectro.description = A powerful turret that is perfect for taking down hoards of enemies from a large distance
block.moon-mod-Leech.name = Leech
block.moon-mod-Leech.description = Deals constant damege to a single target using a medium-ranged laser
block.moon-mod-Stormer.name = Stormer
block.moon-mod-Stormer.description = Long-ranged missle launcher, can use various materials to shoot different types of rockets.
block.moon-mod-Zap.description = despite its size it can deal serious damage and even stun enemies
block.moon-mod-Tide.description = A simple medium-ranged liquid turret
block.moon-mod-Frostbite.description = Absolutley devastetes enemies with its powerful extremly cold fragmentational beam
block.moon-mod-Frostbite.details = This weapon somehow produces a cold laser beam, how can a hot ray of plasma be so cold and even fragmentational? At least we konw one thing... its extremly dangerous
block.moon-mod-pike.description = A small turret, good for taking down single targets
block.moon-mod-pike.name = Pike
block.moon-mod-MoonRay.description = Using energy extracted from moonstone, it is perfect for taking down single aerial targets.
block.moon-mod-Restart.description = A fragmentational superweapon, takes down everything that comes close
block.moon-mod-Restart.details = One of the most powerful inventions of bushark, its only prototype is defending the great Fortress on Zilo, Its Plasma bullets are collapsing from inside evry solid matter that they will touch, it is probably a stronger fragmentational split but with extremly fast spreading chain reaction, this weapon is too complex to research it, it would probably take years...
